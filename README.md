**PREDICTION_OF_MILES_PER_GALLON_FOR_AN_AUTOMOBILE**

**About the Dataset

This project showcases the use of Machine Learning on the Auto MPG dataset('auto-mpg.csv'), sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Link: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Auto+MPG

The dataset contains 398 instances and 8 attributes related to the city-cycle fuel consumption of various cars from the 1970s and 80s.



**Data Description:

1.MPG (Continuous): Miles per Gallon - Metric of vehicle's fuel efficiency

2.Cylinders (Multi-Valued Discrete): Number of Engine Cylinders

3.Displacement (Continuous): The engine displacement - measured in cubic inches (although 'cc' or 'cubic cm' is a more common unit, this dataset has the values in 'cubic inches')

4.Horsepower (Continuous): The brake horsepower of the car's engine - measured in bhp

5.Weight (Continuous): Weight of the car (in lbs)

6.Acceleration (Continuous): Time taken for the vehicle to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph, in seconds

7.Model Year (Multi-Valued Discrete): The car model's year of manufacturing (denoted by the last 2 digits of the year e.g. 1976 -> '76')

8.Origin (Multi-Valued Discrete): The country of Origin/Model Production (1: Canada, 2: USA, 3: Britain)



**Objective:

The main objective of the project is to predict miles per gallon (MPG) of a car, based on its given attributes(characteristics).
This prediction would greatly help the designer engineers in automobile industry,to approximately determine the expected MPG of their designed car and help them make suitable changes to produce a better product. It will help companies maintain competition and increase their chance of customer acquisition and hence profits  as they would be able to design products that customers would like.

**PREDICTION_OF_AUTOMOBILE_SALES

**About the Dataset

This project showcases the use of Machine Learning on the Car Sales dataset('Car_sales.csv'), sourced from kaggle. 

Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hsinha53/car-sales

The dataset contains 157 instances and 16 attributes related to the sales data of automobiles.


**Data Description:

1.Manufacturer (Multi-Valued Discrete): Name of the manufacturer company

2.Model (Multi-Valued Discrete): Model of the car

3.Sales_in_thousands (Continuous): Total sales of the model(in thousands)

4.Year Resale Value (Continuous): Year Resale Value

5.Vehicle Type (Multi-Valued Discrete): Type of vehcile (Sedan-1 Not Sedan-2)

6.Price_in_thousands (Continuous): Price of the car model (in thousands)

7.Engine_size (Continuous): Size of the engine(in litres)

8.Horsepower (Continuous): Engine horsepowwr(in bhp)

9.Wheelbase (Continuous): Length of wheelbase of the car model (in centimetres)

10.Width (Continuous): Width of car model (in centimetres)

11.Length (Continuous): Length of car model (in centimetres)

12.Curb_Weight (Continuous): Total weight of car model with fully filled fuel tank and all necessary equipment onboard (in metric tonnes)

13.Fuel Capacity (Continuous): Total fuel capacity of the vehicle (in gallons)

14.Fuel Efficiency (Continuous): Fuel efficiency of the vehicle 

15.Latest Launch (Multi-Value Discrete): Date of latest launch

16.Power_Perf_Factor (Continuous)

**Objective

The main objective of this project is to predict the automobile sales based on its given attributes(characteristics).
This would help automobile companies to approximately predict the sales of a particular model on the basis of its attributes. Accordingly, they would be able to tweak the characteristics so to maximize their sale,increase their profits and hence compete with other companies.
